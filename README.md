<h1># cordova-angular-angularMaterial-seed</h1>

<p>A seed to start a project using Cordova + AngularJS + Angular-Material</p>
<p>(Note: this isn't an Ionic Framework Seed)</p>

<br/>

<p>Just clone it to you're computer and use it to initialize your projects.</p>

<br/>

* <p>The directory structure is based on this topic:</p>
  https://scotch.io/tutorials/angularjs-best-practices-directory-structure

<br/>

* <p>When looking for Plugins, you should look in here:</p>
  http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/
<p>But you can also use other plugins from standard cordova or anything(where) else.</p>

<br/>

* <p>There are places in the index.html to load your javascript files on the
top of the file, please use it as a guide. (Since it's an app, the files should be load at the start, so the first paint will be complete)</p>

<br/>

* <p>Any time that you'll use an cordova plugin, put it in a 
document.addEventListener "deviceready" function to make sure that it will
work properly. There're few examples in the app.js</p>

<br/>

* <p>The list of Angular-Material Icon and how to then is in here:</p>

<br/>

* <p>The Angular-Material documentation is in here:</p>
  https://material.angularjs.org/latest/

<br/>

* <p>Here's the Material style documentation, take a little look and keep the styles in your mind:</p>

  <p>Keep you main color search here: (This will save your life/time)</p>
  http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette

<br/>

* <p>When you want to debug on Android device, connect the device on your computer via usb and use:</p>
  "cordova run android --device"
  <p>Also use Dev Chrome Tools:</p>
  <a>chrome://inspect/#devices</a>  

<br/>

* <p>This is my favorite son, I'll always keep looking at him, so any thing you want to share with me or any questions you can ask me and/or open an issue, just make a good title so anyone can know what it's about.</p>

<br/>

* <p>Keep in mind that information and knowledg always get better when it's shared with anyone, feel free to use this seed, but still I'll be glad with you mention this repository on your code or repository or share it with your friends. Also, if you do something, I would be glad to recive an link showing your repository or work.</p>
